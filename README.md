# QESlideshow
Quick and Easy Slideshow
Barebones slideshow maker. More features to be added.

Nothing fancy. Runs in a browser locally. Just choose images, choose a song, start. Written in Javascript and HTML. 

Future features wanted:
.mp4 export
Nice UI with image preview and timeline
more sorting options


This is my first shot at writing anything useful so keep that in mind. I actually intend to use this. Every now and then for a wedding, graduation party, or even a funeral, someone has to find time to make a slideshow. None of the free ones I tried ever worked the way I wanted. I decided to try and write one with just enough control to be useful without all the unnecessary features.
